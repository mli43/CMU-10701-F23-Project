      "\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 2 large egg yolks\n",
      "* 1/2 cup (120 ml) neutral-tasting oil, such as canola or grapeseed\n",
      "* 1 tablespoon (15 ml) vinegar or lemon juice\n",
      "* 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) salt\n",
      "* 1/4 teaspoon (1.25 ml) sugar (optional)\n",
      "* 1/4 teaspoon (1.25 ml) cayenne pepper (optional, for some heat)\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and salt until well combined.\n",
      "2. Slowly pour the oil into the egg yolk mixture while continuously whisking. The mixture should start to thicken and emulsify as you pour the oil in.\n",
      "3. Once you have added about half of the oil, add the vinegar or lemon juice and whisk until well combined.\n",
      "4. Continue whisking until the mixture has thickened and emulsified completely, which should take about 5-7 minutes. The mixture should have a thick, creamy consistency.\n",
      "5. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. If the mayonnaise is too thick, you can thin it out with a little bit of water. If it's too thin, you can add a little more oil.\n",
      "6. Transfer the mayonnaise to a jar or airtight container and store it in the fridge for up to one week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some tips to keep in mind when making mayonnaise:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Use a neutral-tasting oil, such as canola or grapeseed, as olive oil can give mayonnaise a distinct flavor.\n",
      "* Make sure to whisk the mixture continuously as you add the oil, as this will help to emulsify the mixture and prevent it from separating.\n",
      "* If you find that your mayonnaise is too thick, you can thin it out with a little bit of water. If it's too thin, you can add a little more oil.\n",
      "* If you want to add some heat to your mayonnaise, you can add a small amount of cayenne pepper to the mixture.\n",
      "* You can also add some other flavorings to your mayonnaise, such as chopped herbs, grated ginger, or minced garlic.\n",
